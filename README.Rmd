An R package for random-forest-empowered imputation of missing Data

## Random-forest-based multiple imputation evolved
This is the repository for R package `RfEmpImp`, for multiple imputation using
random forests (RF).  
This R package is an implementation for the `RfPred` and `RfNode` algorithms and
currently operates under the multiple imputation computation
framework [`mice`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mice).  
The R package contains both newly proposed and improved existing algorithms for
random-forest-based multiple imputation of missing data.  
For details of the newly proposed algorithms, please refer to:
[arXiv:2004.14823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14823) (further updates pending).


## Installation
This R package is already submitted to CRAN, but it may take a while before the
package being approved.  
Currently, interested users can install the package from GitHub:
```r
# Install from GitHub online
if(!"remotes" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("shangzhi-hong/RfEmpImp")
# Install from downloaded source file
install.packages(path_to_source_file, repos = NULL, type = "source")
# Attach
library(RfEmpImp)
```


## Imputation based on predictions
### For mixed types of variables
With version `2.0.0`, the names of parameters were further simplified, please
refer to the documentation for details.  
For data with mixed types of variables, `RfEmp` method is a short cut for
using `RfPred.Emp` for continuous variables and `RfPred.Cate` for categorical
variables (of type `logical` or `factor`).  
Example:
```r
# Prepare data
df <- nhanes
df[, c("age", "hyp")] <- lapply(X = nhanes[, c("age", "hyp")], FUN = as.factor)
# Do imputation
imp <- imp.rfemp(df)
# Do analyses
regObj <- with(imp, lm(chl ~ bmi + hyp))
# Pool analyzed results
poolObj <- pool(regObj)
# Extract estimates
res <- reg.ests(poolObj)
```

### Prediction-based imputation for continuous variables
For continuous variables, in `RfPred.Emp` method, the empirical distribution of
random forest's out-of-bag prediction errors is used to construct the conditional
distributions of the variable under imputation, providing conditional
distributions with better quality. Users can set `method = "rfpred.emp"`
in function call to `mice` to use it.

Also, in `RfPred.Norm` method, normality was assumed for RF prediction errors,
as proposed by Shah *et al.*, and users can set `method = "rfpred.norm"`
in function call to `mice` to use it.

### Prediction-based imputation for categorical variables
For categorical variables, in `RfPred.Cate` method, the probability machine
theory is used, and the predictions of missing categories are based on the
predicted probabilities for each missing observation. Users can set 
`method = "rfpred.cate"` in function call to `mice` to use it.


## Imputation based on predicting nodes
For both continuous variables, the observations under the predicting nodes of
random forest are used as candidates for imputation.  
Two methods are now available for the `RfNode` algorithm.  
Example:
```r
# Prepare data
df <- nhanes
df[, c("age", "hyp")] <- lapply(X = nhanes[, c("age", "hyp")], FUN = as.factor)
# Do imputation
imp <- imp.rfnode.cond(df)
# Or: imp <- imp.rfnode.prox(df)
# Do analyses
regObj <- with(imp, lm(chl ~ bmi + hyp))
# Pool analyzed results
poolObj <- pool(regObj)
# Extract estimates
res <- reg.ests(poolObj)
```


### Node-based imputation using condtional distributions
`RfNode.Cond` uses the conditional distribution formed by the prediction nodes,
i.e. the weight changes of observations caused by the bootstrapping of random
forest are considered, and uses "in-bag" observations only. Users can set 
`method = "rfnode.cond"` in function call to `mice` to use it.

### Node-based imputation using proximities
`RfNode.Prox` uses the concepts of proximity matrices of random forests, and
observations fall under the same predicting nodes are used as candidates for
imputation.  Users can set `method = "rfnode.prox"` in function call to `mice`
to use it.



## Support for parallel computation
The model building for random forest is accelerated using parallel computation
powered by [`ranger`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger). The ranger
software package provides support for parallel computation using native C++.
In our simulations, parallel computation can provide impressive performance boost
for multiple imputation process (about 4x faster on a quad-core laptop).
